Advice for Freshman Parents
---------------------------

Dear Parents of Incoming Freshmen, 

It is normal to feel some anxiety about a change such as moving from middle school to high school. Students feel it and 
their parents do, too. Every year high school leaders look at what we do to make that transition successful and confer 
with the middle schools to try to improve the process. We have asked parents who have one or more students at District 
204 high schools to think about what advice they would give to parents of incoming freshmen or to the freshmen 
themselves. Here is what they said: 

    *"Even though the school seems big, don't be afraid to call the teachers or their department chairs 
    with a concern. They really want to help with your personal concern and will appreciate the call."*
    
    *"It really helped my three kids to get involved in a fall sport or activity. In sports they start before the 
    school year and it gives them a chance to make friends and break the ice."*
    
    *"I tried to be aware of my kids' friends and help them pick positive influences. Peer influence makes 
    a big difference."*
    
    *"Communication. Call the school because no question is too small. Talk with other parents, too, and 
    network with them."*
    
    *"Clear your schedule because you need time and emotional energy for what's going on with your 
    teen.*
    
    *"Parents should stay involved and engaged with their kids even though teens are more independent."*
    
    *"Don't be naive or over-accusatory. Your kids face the same temptations as everybody else's. It's 
    easy to break a trust and hard to rebuild it."*
    
    *"Kids should be involved in activities at school, not preoccupied with working. Working doesn't teach 
    them how to manage money. It often allows them to learn how to waste it."*
    
    *"Don't believe stories about how lenient other parents are. If in doubt, call other parents."*
    
    *"If students have the ability, they should take the challenging classes. Be realistic. Don't take the 
    easiest path."*
    
We wish you well in your own adjustment to the high school experience and hope these bits of practical advice from 
fellow parents will help you. 

Sincerely, 

Kristine Marchiando, Principal of Waubonsie Valley High School 

Robert McBride, Principal, Neuqua Valley High School

Mission Statement and Values
----------------------------
Our mission is to prepare all students to succeed in an ever-changing world through 
comprehensive programs and experiences in collaboration with family and community. 

We know: 
    including and respecting all people strengthens public education; 
    we cultivate a climate charged with enthusiasm for teaching and learning; 
    we challenge all students to reach their potential; 
    our students must develop the skills to become lifelong learners; 
    students learn best in a safe and caring environment; 

education works best when the entire community participates and shares the responsibility.

Definitions and Procedures
--------------------------

**Credit Earned** - All credit is awarded on a semester basis. A student must pass each semester of a year long course.
For purposes of graduation, in a year-long course, generally the entire year must be completed for credit to be given; 
two exceptions (two single semesters of two different year-long courses) may be allowed. Forms to withdraw from a 
year-long course at the end of first semester are available in the Guidance Office. Students may not sign up for only one 
semester of a full year course unless they are repeating due to failure. 

**Course Load** - The maximum course load per semester will be six courses plus P.E. The minimum course load is four 
courses per semester plus P.E. Course loads of less than the minimum are not approved except when students are 
beyond their eight semesters of attendance or in case of serious student or family illness. 

**Physical Education** - All students must register for physical education for each semester in attendance. Health class 
will be required for one semester during the sophomore year in lieu of physical education. 
Early Dismissal/Late Arrival - Seniors who have sufficient credits, and whose courses can be arranged during initial 
scheduling to fit these special requests, may elect to have early dismissal or late arrival. Written parental permission 
and counselor approval are required for these options. 

Grading Scale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    A (91-100) 

    B (81-90) 

    C (71-80) 

    D (65-70) 

    F BELOW 65 

Valedictorian/Salutatorian Policy
---------------------------------

We believe that valedictorian and salutatorian honors should recognize both excellence in the form of grades earned and 
effort in the form of the number of courses taken during the school day.

The valedictorian is that student who, at the end of seven semesters, has earned the highest **total grade points** (not 
average) in high school courses taken, excluding courses taken in summer school, through correspondence, in the 
evening, or otherwise not a part of the scheduled student day at our high schools. A course taken outside these 
parameters may be included **only if both of the following criteria are met:** 1) The student has already completed 
our course offerings in that curricular area. 2) The course does not exceed the maximum of 7 courses allowed per 
semester. The salutatorian is that student with the second highest **grade point total** (not average). The valedictorian 
and salutatorian will not necessarily be the top two students ranked by grade point average. In order to receive such 
senior honors, students must complete the eighth semester. 

(Example: A student who took 7 courses each semester, 3 of those weighted, and received straight A's would have 31 
grade points each semester (3 x 5.0=15; 4 x 4.0=16; total=31). After 7 semesters that total would be 217 grade points. 
She or he would be valedictorian if that were the highest total. Someone with 216 grade points would be salutatorian.) 

[Note: It is important to note that this is not just grade point average. GPA will still be computed because class rank 
based on grade point average is so frequently requested by colleges.] 

Class Rank
^^^^^^^^^^

Students are considered for inclusion in class rank as determined by the following criteria: 
    
    Students are assessed relative to their performance on curricular course standards. 
    Students receive grades that are representative of this performance. 
    Students will be excluded from class rank if they receive significant modifications to course work that substantially change course standards. 

**Honor Roll** - At the conclusion of each semester, full-time students may qualify for the regular honor roll with a GPA 
3.25 - 3.59. Students with a GPA of 3.6 or above will be placed on the high honor roll.
