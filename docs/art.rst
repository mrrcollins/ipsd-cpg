The District 204 Art Program seeks to provide a variety of experiences in the visual arts that enable our students to 
appreciate and enjoy art; to help guide life and career choices they will make during their high school tenure; to prepare 
them for further study in art; and to increase their understanding of an increasingly visual world. In most art classes, 
students will make projects that can be taken home. There is a material fee associated with such classes payable at the 
start of class.
